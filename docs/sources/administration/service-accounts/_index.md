# Service accounts in Grafana

A service account is generally a regular user account, but used to run automated or compute workloads with care for specific use cases.

{{< section >}}

TODO:

- noncaptial service accounts instead of Service accounts expect normal titel and new paragraphs
- in title and headers write more context for it ( add mostly ... in Grafana)
- topic title can have 7-12 words in a topic title ( is important for communicating what is really in the topic )
- bold stem sentence
- make the steps with references to each link in the documentation and clearler reference the api or where in the docs it is

need to be able to explain the difference of apikey to the naming of token
