# About API keys in Grafana

A API Key is a randomly generated string that is used to interact with the Grafana HTTP APIs.

When you create an API key, you specify a **Role** that determines permissions. For more information about creating API keys, refer to [Create an API key]({{< relref "./create-api-key.md#">}}).
