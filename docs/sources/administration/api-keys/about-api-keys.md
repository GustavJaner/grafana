# About API keys in Grafana

An API key is a encrypted string that identifies as a specific role to your Grafana instance when talking to apis. You can more easily use Grafana HTTP APIs by leveraging API keys.

An API key is valid for up to 30 days.

When you create an API key, you specify a role that determines which permissions the key has. For more information about creating API keys, refer to [Create an API key]({{< relref "./create-api-key.md#">}}).
